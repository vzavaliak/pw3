            <h1>PAOLO MALDINI</h1>
            <p>
                Paolo Cesare Maldini ( born 26 June 1968) is an Italian
                former professional footballer who played primarily as a left back and central defender for A.C. Milan
                and the Italy national team. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest ever defenders, with some
                considering him to be the best ever, and as one of the greatest players of all time.
                As the Milan and Italy captain for many years he was nicknamed "Il Capitano" ("The Captain"). Maldini
                held the record for most appearances in Serie A, with 647, until 2020, when he was overtaken by
                Gianluigi Buffon.[ He is currently serving as technical director for Milan, as well as being co-owner
                of USL Championship club Miami FC.

                Maldini spent all 25 seasons of his playing career in the Serie A with Milan, before retiring at the age
                of 41 in 2009. He won 25 trophies with Milan: the European Cup/UEFA Champions League five times, seven
                Serie A titles, one Coppa Italia, five Supercoppa Italiana titles, five European/UEFA Super Cups, two
                Intercontinental Cups and one FIFA Club World Cup. Maldini won the Best Defender trophy at the UEFA Club
                Football Awards at the age of 39, as well as the Serie A Defender of the Year Award in 2004. Following
                his retirement after the 2008–09 season, Milan retired his number 3 shirt.

                Maldini made his debut for Italy in 1988, playing for 14 years before retiring in 2002 with 7 goals and
                126 caps, an appearance record at the time, which has since been surpassed by Fabio Cannavaro and
                Gianluigi Buffon. Maldini captained Italy for eight years and held the record for appearances as Italy's
                captain (74), until he was again overtaken by Cannavaro and Buffon. With Italy, Maldini took part in
                four FIFA World Cups and three UEFA European Championships. Although he did not win a tournament with
                Italy, he reached the final of the 1994 World Cup and Euro 2000, and the semi-final of the 1990 World
                Cup and Euro 1988. He was elected into the all-star teams for each of these tournaments, in addition to
                Euro 1996.

                Maldini came second to George Weah for FIFA World Player of the Year in 1995. He also placed third in
                the Ballon d'Or in 1994 and 2003.[15] In 2002, he was chosen as a defender on the FIFA World Cup Dream
                Team, and in 2004 Pelé named him in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players. He was
                also selected for the Ballon d'Or Dream Team in 2020. Maldini held the record for most appearances in
                UEFA Club competitions, with 174, until he was overtaken by Iker Casillas in 2017. He is the record
                appearance holder for Milan with 902 appearances in all competitions, and is one of only eighteen
                players to have made over 1,000 career appearances. In December 2012, he was inducted into
                the Italian Football Hall of Fame. Maldini's father Cesare also played for and captained Milan, and
                was a successful national under-21 manager, who also coached Milan and the senior national side during
                the 1998 World Cup.

            <H3>1984–1987: Youth career, Milan senior debut and early professional career</H3>

            <P>
                Originally a Milan youth squad product, Maldini also went on to play his entire club career with the
                Milan senior side. He won the Coppa Italia Primavera with the Milan Youth side during the 1984–85
                season, and he made his league debut for Milan under manager Nils Liedholm during the same season on 20
                January 1985, replacing the injured Sergio Battistini in a match against Udinese at age 16. It was
                his only league appearance of the campaign, but he was immediately made a member of the starting eleven
                the following season, at age 17, at right-back, being handed the number 3 shirt, which had previously
                also belonged to his father, Cesare. He was later switched to his more iconic position of left-back
                due to his ability with his left foot. Maldini also made his Coppa Italia debut in 1985, on 21 August,
                while his debut in European competition also came later that same year, on 18 September. He scored
                the first of his 29 goals in Serie A on 4 January 1987 in a 1–0 win against Como.

            <H3>1987–1991: Domestic and international success with The immortals</H3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                The 1987–88 Scudetto under Arrigo Sacchi marked Maldini's first trophy, and the first of seven league
                titles, with the club.[28] Nicknamed "The Immortals", Sacchi's Milan side is remembered for including
                the Dutch trio of Frank Rijkaard, Ruud Gullit and Marco van Basten, as well as the Italian midfielders
                Carlo Ancelotti, Roberto Donadoni (and later Demetrio Albertini), and a strong defensive lineup.
                Under Sacchi and later Fabio Capello, Maldini formed with long-timers Franco Baresi, Alessandro
                Costacurta, Mauro Tassotti, as well as Filippo Galli, Stefano Nava and later Christian Panucci, one of
                football's strongest defensive quartets of all time.[a] During the 1987–88 Serie A season, Milan only
                conceded 14 goals, finishing with the best defence in Italy, as they went on to win the Serie A title.
                Following Baresi's retirement, he also formed a formidable and successful partnership with Alessandro
                Nesta. Maldini went on to win the 1988 Supercoppa Italiana with Milan the following season, and followed
                up this trophy with back to back European Cup titles in 1988–89 and 1989–90, while Milan finished in
                third and in second place in Serie A during those respective seasons. On 19 February 1989,
                Maldini made his 100th appearance in Serie A.

                Milan reached the final of the 1989–90 Coppa Italia, losing out to Juventus. Milan also managed to
                capture successive European Super Cup titles in 1989 and 1990, as well as successive Intercontinental
                Cup titles, once again 1989 and 1990. The following season, in Sacchi's final season with the club,
                Milan were eliminated in the quarter-finals of the European Cup by eventual finalists Marseille, and
                finished second in Serie A, behind Sampdoria, once again with the best defence in the league, conceding
                only 19 goals. Milan reached the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia, losing out to eventual champions Roma.
                In 1989, Maldini was awarded the Bravo Award, as the best under-23 player in European Competitions

            <h3>1991–1996: Continued success with The invincibles</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Under Sacchi's replacement, Fabio Capello, Milan continued to be a dominant force in Italy and in
                Europe. Maldini was also part of Milan's undefeated Serie A team, which won the championship in the
                1991–92 season; in total, Milan went unbeaten for an Italian record of 58 league matches, earning the
                nickname "The Invincibles".[38] This championship was Milan's first of three consecutive Serie A titles
                under Capello in the early 1990s. Maldini helped Milan defend the Serie A title the following season,
                and reach the first of three consecutive UEFA Champions League finals. Milan lost the 1993 Champions
                League final in a 1–0 defeat to Marseille. That season, Maldini scored his first goal in European
                Competitions on 21 October 1992 in a 1–0 Champions League win against Slovan Bratislava,[26] and also
                made his 200th appearance in Serie A on 4 October of the same year.[24] The following season, Milan
                captured their third consecutive Serie A title, finishing with the best defence in Italy, conceding just
                15 goals. Maldini also helped lead Milan to a second consecutive Champions League final, where he helped
                his team defeat Barcelona. Due to Alessandro Costacurta's suspension and injuries sustained to Franco
                Baresi, Jean-Pierre Papin and Marco van Basten, Barcelona's "Dream Team", coached by Johan Cruyff, were
                heavy favourites to win the trophy, with the formidable attacking duo of Romário and Hristo
                Stoichkov.[39] Despite their key absences, Maldini helped the Milan defence keep a clean sheet and
                overcome Barcelona 4–0 in the final, with two goals from Daniele Massaro and one each from Dejan
                Savićević and Marcel Desailly.[26][27][39]

                After winning his third Champions League title and reaching the 1994 World Cup final, Maldini became the
                first defender ever to win World Soccer magazine's annual World Player of the Year Award. During his
                acceptance speech, Maldini called his milestone "a particular matter of pride because defenders
                generally receive so much less attention from fans and the media than goalscorers. We are more in the
                engine room rather than taking the glory".[40] He then singled out Milan captain Franco Baresi as a
                player who "really [deserved] to receive the sort of award I have received".[40] Maldini also placed
                third in the 1994 Ballon d'Or, behind Stoichkov and compatriot Roberto Baggio, and fifth in the FIFA
                World Player of the Year Award.

            <h3>1996–2001: Assuming the captaincy, struggles, and 1999 Serie A titl</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Following Capello's departure, and the aging and retirement of several key players, Milan suffered
                disappointing results during the next few seasons, undergoing several managerial changes. Milan lost the
                Supercoppa Italiana to Fiorentina in 1996, and failed to qualify for European competitions for two
                consecutive seasons, as well as suffering a group stage elimination in the 1996–97 Champions League.
                Following Franco Baresi's and Mauro Tassotti's retirement after the 1996–97 season, Maldini was
                appointed Milan's captain. Despite the difficulties Milan encountered during this period, through
                Maldini's leadership, they reached the Coppa Italia final in 1998, losing to Lazio, and won the 1998–99
                Serie A title under Alberto Zaccheroni, finishing one point ahead of Lazio. He made his 400th Serie A
                appearance on 25 April 1999.[24] In the 1999–2000 season, Milan lost the Supercoppa Italiana against
                Parma, finished third in Serie A and finished bottom of their Champions League group. Milan were
                eliminated in the second round of the Champions League the next season and finished in sixth place in
                Serie A, failing to qualify for the Champions League, and participated in the UEFA Cup the following
                season

            <h3>2001–2007: New era of succes</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Maldini lifting the European Cup for Milan after winning the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final.
                Milan again became a dominant force in Italy and in Europe under Carlo Ancelotti. In the 2001–02 season,
                Milan finished in fourth place, qualifying for the Champions League, and also reached their best ever
                finish in the UEFA Cup, losing in the semi-finals. In 2002, Maldini was awarded the Premio Nazionale
                Carriera Esemplare "Gaetano Scirea", for his career achievements and personality.[41] The following
                season, Maldini lined up with Alessandro Nesta, Alessandro Costacurta and Cafu, who, along with Jaap
                Stam during the 2004–05 season, formed a formidable defensive lineup in Italy and in Europe. Milan
                finished third in Serie A, but Maldini won the first Coppa Italia of his career, defeating Roma in the
                final.[26][27] On 15 March 2003, he made his 500th appearance in Serie A.[24]

                Milan won the 2002–03 Champions League with Maldini as their captain for the first time in his career,
                in the first all-Italian final, against Juventus, on 28 May 2003 at Old Trafford. Maldini helped Milan
                keep a clean sheet, as they defeated Juventus 3–2 on penalties after a 0–0 deadlock following extra
                time. On that day, it was exactly 40 years since his father, Cesare, had also lifted the European Cup
                trophy as Milan's captain, also in England.[42] He and his father are only one of three other father-son
                pairs to have also done so; the others being Manuel Sanchís Martínez and Manuel Sanchís Hontiyuelo of
                Real Madrid, and Carles and Sergio Busquets of Barcelona. Maldini was elected Man of the Match and was
                named in the UEFA Team of the Year for the first time in his career.[26][27]

                The following season, Milan were defeated by Juventus on penalties in the Supercoppa Italiana, and in
                the Intercontinental Cup final by Boca Juniors, once again on penalties, but managed to defeat Porto to
                capture yet another UEFA Super Cup. Maldini placed third in the 2003 Ballon d'Or for the second time in
                his career. Maldini went on to captain Milan to win the Serie A title that season, with a record 82
                points, whilst Milan were eliminated in the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia by Lazio, and in the
                quarter-finals of the Champions League by Deportivo de La Coruña. In April 2004, Maldini placed tenth on
                the 'UEFA Golden Jubilee Poll, an online UEFA survey, which was organised to commemorate the best
                European footballers of the past 50 years. Maldini was the second-highest placed Italian after Dino
                Zoff.[43] Maldini was also included in the FIFA 100 list in 2004, which was a selection of the 125
                greatest living footballers, chosen by Pelé. Following his Series A-winning performances, Maldini was
                elected to be the Serie A Defender of the Year in 2004 at the Italian footballing Awards.

            <h3>2008–2009: Final years and retirement</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                On 16 February 2008, in the match against Parma at the Stadio Ennio Tardini, Maldini came on for
                defender Marek Jankulovski to make his 1,000th professional career appearance,[50][51] of which 861 were
                with Milan, 12 with the Italy under-21 side, 1 with the Italian Olympic team and 126 with the Italy
                senior team.[52] In European football, only the English goalkeeper Peter Shilton had collected more
                appearances at the time: 1,390 between 1966 and 1997. Maldini played his last game in the Champions
                League on 4 March 2008, a 2–0 loss at the San Siro in the last 16 against Arsenal which eliminated Milan
                from the 2007–08 Champions League. In 2008, Maldini was awarded the FIFA Order of Merit, as well as the
                Premio Internazionale Giacinto Facchetti, which is awarded to a player who was demonstrated both skill
                and fair play throughout his career.[


                Maldini in 2009.
                On 18 April 2009, Maldini announced that he would retire at the end of the 2008–09 season.[26][27] On 17
                May 2009, in the Stadio Friuli, Maldini played his 900th official match for Milan in a league game
                against Udinese. Maldini's last match in San Siro was on 24 May, a 3–2 loss against Roma, and was given
                a standing ovation by the fans. There was a small controversy, however, when the Milan Ultras fans known
                as Brigate Rossonere protested against Maldini as he said goodbye.[54][55] His last appearance for
                Milan, and his last game as an active player, was a 2–0 win against Fiorentina on 31 May 2009 in the
                last match of the Serie A season. This win meant Milan finished in third place and qualified for the
                following season's Champions League. Maldini was once again given a standing ovation by the fans. As
                they had previously done with Franco Baresi's number 6 shirt, Milan retired Maldini's number 3 shirt,
                but stated that it will be bequeathed to one of his sons if one of them were to make the club's senior
                team.

                On 28 August 2009 in Monte Carlo, Paolo Maldini was Awarded a prize for his career by UEFA during the
                draw for the group stage of the 2009–10 Champions League.[58] On 17 November 2009, Spanish sports
                newspaper Marca awarded Maldini the "Marca Leyenda" prize for his career and achievements.

            <h2>INTERNATIONAL CAREER</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Early career and 1990 World Cup</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                In 1986, Maldini was called up by his father Cesare Maldini to the Italian under-21 national team, and
                made his debut for the team on the 12 November of that year, in a 0–0 draw against Austria;[61][24] he
                earned 12 caps and scored five goals in two years with the azzurrini,[61] with his first goal coming on
                11 February 1987, in a 2–1 win against Portugal.[61][24] Maldini was also member of the under-21 team
                that finished runners-up to Spain in the 1986 UEFA European Under-21 Championship.[62][63] Two years
                later, he also featured for the under-21 team that was eliminated in the first round against eventual
                winners France in the 1988 UEFA European Under-21 Championship.[64]


                Maldini's Italy jersey from the 1990 FIFA World Cup, located in the Football Museum in Florence.
                Maldini made his senior debut for the Italy senior team at age 19 on 31 March 1988 in a 1–1 friendly
                draw against Yugoslavia in Split,[65] and made one appearance for the Italy Olympic squad on 28 October
                1987,[24] although he was not part of the team that finished in fourth place at the 1988 Olympics.
                Maldini featured in all four of Italy's games at UEFA Euro 1988, where they reached the semi-finals,
                losing to the Soviet Union.[
            </p>

            <h3>1994 World Cup Final and appointment to captaincy</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Maldini's first international goal came in his 44th career match, in a 2–0 friendly win over Mexico in
                Florence on 20 January 1993.[65] Maldini was part of the Italy squad that participated in the 1992 U.S.
                Cup, finishing in second place in the friendly tournament, behind the host nation. Italy failed to
                qualify for Euro 1992, finishing second in their group, but qualified for the 1994 World Cup, where
                Maldini was named vice-captain for Italy. During the 1994 World Cup, Maldini played in all seven of
                Italy's matches, and deputised for the injured Franco Baresi in the matches against Mexico, Nigeria,
                Spain and Bulgaria, keeping a clean sheet in the group match against Norway. Maldini led the Italian
                defence to the final, playing both as a centre-back and as a full-back, due to the absences of his Milan
                and Italy defensive teammates Baresi, due to injury, Mauro Tassotti, due to suspension after the
                quarter-finals, and Alessandro Costacurta, who was suspended for the final. Maldini helped Italy keep a
                clean sheet in the final against favourites Brazil as the team eventually lost on penalties. As in 1990,
                Maldini was named in the Team of the Tournament, 32 years after his father Cesare received the same
                honour at the 1962 World Cup.


                After Franco Baresi's international retirement in 1994, Maldini was appointed the team's full-time
                captain. A disappointing Euro 1996 campaign saw Italy eliminated in the group stage with four points, in
                a group which contained the two eventual finalists of the tournament, Germany and the Czech Republic.
                Maldini played in all three of Italy's group matches. The 1998 World Cup in France saw Italy start
                strongly, topping their group. Maldini played in all five of Italy's matches, and started the play that
                led to Christian Vieri's opening goal in Italy's first match against Chile, which ended in a 2–2 draw.
                Maldini, partnering with Alessandro Costacurta, Fabio Cannavaro, Alessandro Nesta and Giuseppe Bergomi,
                also helped Italy to keep clean sheets in the second group match against Cameroon, the round of 16 match
                Norway and France in the quarter-finals, but Italy eventually went out of the tournament to the hosts
                and eventual champions on penalties, for the third consecutive time in a World Cup.

            <h3>Euro 2000 Final and fourth World Cup</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Maldini made his 100th appearance for Italy on 28 April 1999, in a 0–0 friendly away draw against
                Croatia, under manager Dino Zoff.[69] The following year, Italy reached the final of Euro 2000, but lost
                once again to defending World Cup champions France in extra time. Maldini played in all six of Italy's
                matches during the tournament. Italy topped their group, winning every match, and Maldini, starting
                alongside Fabio Cannavaro and Alessandro Nesta, helped the Italian defence to concede only two goals en
                route to the final, keeping clean sheets against co-hosts Belgium in the group stage, Romania in the
                quarter-finals and co-hosts the Netherlands in the semi-finals. A ten-man Italy advanced to the final on
                penalties after a 0–0 draw with the Dutch following extra time. Although Maldini missed his penalty,
                Italy won the shootout 3–1.[70] Italy were leading 1–0 in the final until Wiltord equalised in the final
                minute of stoppage time. David Trezeguet scored the golden goal in the 103rd minute, in extra time.[71]
                In all of the three UEFA European Championships in which Maldini participated, he was elected to be part
                of the team of the tournament for his performances.[27]

                On 7 October 2000, in a 3–0 win over Romania in Milan in a 2002 World Cup qualifier, Maldini overtook
                Dino Zoff to become Italy's most capped player of all time with his 113th senior international
                appearance for Italy.[72] Maldini played in his fourth World Cup, and his second as captain, in the 2002
                World Cup in Korea and Japan. He helped Italy keep a clean sheet in their opening win against Ecuador,
                and played in all four of Italy's matches. Italy disappointed in the remaining group matches, but went
                on to the knockout round as the second placed team of their group. Immediately after a ten-man Italy
                were controversially eliminated in the round of sixteen, by a golden goal, to co-hosts South Korea,
                Maldini retired from international football, at the age of 34, as Italy's most capped player.[27] He
                scored seven international goals, all coming in home games. He spent over half of his 16 years as an
                international as team captain, wearing the armband a record 74 times,[73] until he was overtaken by
                Cannavaro, and subsequently Buffon.[61][74] Despite his performances for his country, Maldini was unable
                to win a trophy, although he reached the final of both the World Cup and the European Championship.
                Maldini made 23 appearances in World Cups, the second highest total after Lothar Matthäus, who appeared
                in 25 matches. Maldini holds the record for most minutes played in World Cup matches with 2,216 minutes
                played.[75]

                In February 2009, Italian head coach Marcello Lippi declared his support for a testimonial match for
                Maldini, stating that it would give him a chance to play for the Azzurri for a final time.[76] The
                Italian Football Federation (FIGC) offered him a place in the line-up in a friendly match against
                Northern Ireland. Maldini, however, rejected the offer, saying that he wanted to part with football in
                an "official" match

            <h2>PLAYER PROFILE</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Style of play</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Although he played as a left back for most of his career, Maldini was naturally right footed, and began
                playing for Milan as a right back. He was switched to the left back position by manager Arrigo Sacchi
                due to the presence of Mauro Tassotti on the right for Milan.[95] This was made possible due to
                Maldini's tactical versatility and ability with both feet, which allowed him to play anywhere along the
                backline, and have a long and successful professional career, both with Milan and Italy.[96][97]

                Maldini was renowned for his technical ability, athleticism, sliding tackles, stamina, composure and
                fast energetic forward runs as a left-back or wing-back.[100][101][102][103][104] He was also an
                excellent crosser of the ball, and was an effective attacking threat, scoring and assisting several
                goals throughout his career.[105][106] In the final few years of his career, as he lost speed, he was
                moved to a centre-back position, where he excelled in relying on his experience, tactical ability,
                positioning and timing to win the ball.

                As a centre-back, Maldini was renowned for his marking, awareness and ability to anticipate a threat
                from the opposition. Despite being a precise tackler and an imposing defensive presence, he
                often avoided committing to challenges when he deemed them unnecessary,[109] preferring to restrict the
                offensive play of his opponents through his positioning and marking.[110] Maldini was also known for his
                aerial ability, strength, tackling and man-marking, as well as his tactical knowledge.[96][100][111] His
                passing range and ability to begin plays from the backline also allowed him to advance into the midfield
                and excel in the sweeper or libero position, on the rare occasion that he was deployed in this role.

            <h3>Legacy</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Maldini is considered to have been one of the greatest defenders of all time, and has been described as
                "an icon and gentleman of the game".[11][114] He was known for his calm and composed manner on the
                pitch, as well as his ability to read the game, preferring elegance and intelligence to physicality and
                aggression when defending; regarded as a correct player, known for his discipline on the pitch, he only
                received three red cards throughout his entire career. In a 2002 FIFA poll, Maldini was
                selected as a defender in the FIFA World Cup Dream Team.

                Maldini's number 3 Milan jersey (next to Dejan Savićević's number 10) in the San Siro museum
                Maldini was the first defender ever shortlisted for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, finishing
                second in 1995.[119] He was also twice elected as a finalist for the Ballon d'Or, in 1994 and in 2003,
                where he finished third on both occasions. In addition to his team success, he also won several
                individual accolades and awards. He won the UEFA Defender of the year, the Serie A defender of the year,
                the Bravo Award and the World Soccer Player of the Year Award. He has also been elected as part of the
                UEFA Team of the Year, the FIFPro World XI, the World Cup Team of the Tournament and the European
                Championship Team of the Tournament during his career. Maldini was a symbol of his club and the Italian
                national football team.[120][121] He was renowned for his consistency, versatility, work-rate, and
                longevity, breaking into the Milan starting lineup as a teenager and remaining there throughout his
                career until he retired at the age of 41.[122]

                Throughout his career, Maldini was also considered to be a leader, both for Milan and for the Italian
                national team, earning the nickname "Il Capitano" ("The Captain"). He was renowned for his vocal,
                commanding presence on the pitch, and for his awareness, communication and organisational skills,
                helping to motivate his teammates and ensuring they remained in position. He played in over 1,000
                professional matches during his 25 seasons at Milan, and was the record appearance holder in Serie A
                until he was overtaken by Gianluigi Buffon in 2020, and still is for Milan in all competitions. Maldini
                also appeared in a record eight UEFA Champions League Finals, and is the record appearance holder in all
                UEFA club competitions.[108] With 126 caps during the 16 years he played for Italy, he was the record
                appearance holder for the national team, until he was overtaken by Fabio Cannavaro in 2009 and by
                Gianluigi Buffon in 2013. He also formerly held the record number of caps for Italy as captain, wearing
                the armband on 74 occasions, until being overtaken by Cannavaro. Maldini has inspired many
                defenders like Rio Ferdinand, Rafael Márquez and Carles Puyol.

            <h2>PERSONAL LIFE</h2>

            <p>
                Maldini was born in Milan to Cesare Maldini and Maria Luisa De Mezzi.[133] He has been married to
                Venezuelan former model Adriana Fossa since December 1994.[134][135] The couple have two sons,
                Christian
                (born 14 June 1996) and Daniel (born 11 October 2001),[136] who both have been signed by Maldini's
                former club Milan and played in the youth teams.[137][138] His father Cesare was also a footballer
                who
                also played as a defender, captained Milan, and represented the Italy national team, later going on
                to
                become a coach. Throughout Cesare's managerial career, he coached his son both in the Italy under-21
                side and the senior team, as well as at Milan, also managing several other teams.[139] On 3 April
                2016,
                Paolo's father Cesare died at the age of 84;[140] his mother died later that year, on 28
                July.[133][141]

                Maldini has his own fashion label – Sweet Years – which he runs with friend and former Italy and
                Milan
                teammate Christian Vieri.[142][143]

                On 21 March 2020, it was confirmed that Maldini and his son Daniel both tested positive for
                COVID-19,
                amid its pandemic in Italy;[144][145] by 8 April, he and his son had recovered
